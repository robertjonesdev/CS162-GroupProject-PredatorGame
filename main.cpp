** Program name: main.cpp (part of CS162 Group Project)
** Author:       Group 16 (LB, LB, RJ, DS, AW)
** Date:         February 6, 2019
** Description:  This is the main file that prompts the user to
**               create a Board object and runs the simulation.
**			     The simulation is cellular automata in a 2D predatorâ€“prey game.
**				 The preys are ants and the predators are doodlebugs. The
**				 ants and doodlebugs move about a regular grid. Ants will breed
**			     and Doodlebugs will breed, eat Ants, and/or starve.
**			     The user will see each resulting "time step" or "round" displayed
**				 to the computer console at the conclusion of each time step.
**				 The user will specify the size of the board, number of starting
**				 Doodlebugs and Ants, and the number of simulation time steps.
**				 At the conclusion the user will have the options to quit or
**				 continue for another user-specified amount of steps.
