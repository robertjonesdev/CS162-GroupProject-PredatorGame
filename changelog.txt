Day 1 (Feb 2)

What I did today:

1. Made makefile super spiffy:
 -it automatically sees all the .cpp files in the directory and compiles them, now you don't need to manually edit filenames for each project.
 -"make clean" works on Windows now
2. Added a Board constructor that takes an int, so we can initialize numSteps we get from the user in main.
3. Added greeting to main, prompting user for number of steps to run. 5000 is a completely arbitrary limit, we can change it.
4. Added my input validation functions, feel free to use them. 
 -Also includes clearScreen(), which clears the screen, and systemPause() which pauses the screen an prompts the user to press enter to continue.
5. added enum to Critter class for movement: (Up is 0, right is 1, down is 2, left is 3)
6. changed Critter move function to take the board (Critter*** gameBoard) as an arguement, so critters can check if spaces are adjacent
7. changed all references to "x" and "y" to "row" and "col". Previously critters' location was x-y and the board was row-col, and I'm too dumb to be able to tell them apart on the fly.
8. Added Ant::move function. I did a whole bunch of tests and finally got it working
9. added bools "isAnt" and "isDoodlebug" to Critter class & ant/doodlebug constructors, and getIsAnt() and getIsDoodlebug() functions to Critter
 -This way to move, we can iterate through the board, look for the isAnt/isDoodlebug flags and do stuff.
10. Edited the printBoard() function to use the "isAnt/isDoodlebug" bools, the static_cast was giving weird behavior.
